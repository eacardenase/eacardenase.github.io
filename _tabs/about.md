iOS developer with a strong foundation in Swift, UIKit, AutoLayout, SwiftUI, Core Data, Networking, and Firebase using MVC and MVVM architectures, as well as experience in unit and integration testing with XCTest and consuming RESTful APIs. 

In addition, my background in backend development, including NodeJS, Laravel, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, would allow me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional and multicultural teams and provide a holistic approach to development.

As a passionate and quick learner, I am eager to expand my skill set and take ownership of my work, delivering high-quality, well-documented, modular, and maintainable code.
