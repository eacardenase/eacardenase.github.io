iOS developer with a strong foundation in Swift, UIKit, AutoLayout, Core Data, Networking, concurrency (GCD and Operations) and Firebase using MVC and MVVM architectures, as well as experience in unit and integration testing with XCTest and RESTful APIs integration.

In addition, my background in backend development with NodeJS, MySQL and Redis, allow me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and provide a holistic approach to development.
